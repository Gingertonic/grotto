ISSUES THAT AROSE:
wrong singularization of Dives (Dife!)
fixed by adding activesupport gem and making an inflection file in config folder, required in config.ru

tux not loading
fixed by using require not require_relative in config.ru

has_many, through assocatioan not working
fixed by simplifying - join table was not required
