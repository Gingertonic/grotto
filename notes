ISSUES THAT AROSE:
WEDNESDAY
wrong singularization of Dives (Dife!)
fixed by adding activesupport gem and making an inflection file in config folder, required in config.ru

tux not loading
fixed by using require not require_relative in config.ru

has_many, through assocatioan not working
fixed by simplifying - join table was not required

    He can look at a list of all the divesites that have been added to Grotto.
    He can see a page dedicated to a particular divesite and see a list of all the Grotto users who have logged a dive at that site as well as local dive centres.
    He can edit the divesite but only if it still has a name, location and country AND the updated divesite details do not create a duplicate of another divesite.
