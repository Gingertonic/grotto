NOTES

CURRENT LIMITATIONS
each user can only log 1 dive per divespot on a given date
clunky divesite selection in new and edit page - better to group by country?

TO DO
- write a few tests
- test the tests!

Models:
Users
first name
last name
username
email
password/password_digest

Dive
date
divesite_id
user_id
  (future feature, has 2 users? 2 dive buddies?)
